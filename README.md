# Mock Social Media GUI
NOTE: Certain buttons/features unlock when certain actions are taken. e.g. when you hover over a tree element depending on if its a user or a group, you can add users or groups under that element, if a user is selected the user open view button is unlocked, etc.
NOTE: In the demo I did not go over the Positive Percentage button because I did not get around to fully being able to support that functionality.
Also, my screen recording didn't capture everything for some reason, when I added the users/groups and clicked on the buttons to view statistics new pop-ups would open up but I couldn't figure a workaround in time to capture everything in the demo unfortunately.
