NOTE: Certain buttons/features unlock when certain actions are taken. e.g. when you hover over a tree element depending on if its a user or a group, you can add users or groups under that element, if a user is selected the user open view button is unlocked, etc.
NOTE: In the demo I did not go over the Positive Percentage button because I did not get around to fully being able to support that functionality, did not figure out how to incorporate tweets from other users into the listview.
Also, my screen recording didn't capture everything for some reason, when I added the users/groups and clicked on the buttons to view statistics new pop-ups would open up but I couldn't figure a workaround in time to capture everything in the demo unfortunately.
